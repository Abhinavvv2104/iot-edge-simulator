#  IoT Edge Emulator with Anomaly Detection & MQTT Streaming

A Python-based project that simulates electrical sensor data, performs edge-level processing (like anomaly detection and power tracking), and publishes results over MQTT.

Designed for testing IoT pipelines, dashboards, and cloud integrations.

---

##  Features

-  Sensor Emulator: Simulates real-time voltage, current, power, energy, and power factor readings
-  Edge Processing:
  - Simple Moving Average (SMA)
  - Voltage & Current Anomaly Detection
  - Energy consumption tracking
  - Rolling average of Power Factor
-  MQTT Publishing: Publishes all processed data to a local MQTT broker
-  CSV Data Logger: MQTT subscriber that logs incoming data to a `.csv` file
- Modular Design: Each component (emulator, edge processor, MQTT client) is cleanly separated

##  How to Run

### 1. Start MQTT Broker
(Make sure Mosquitto is installed)
mosquitto -v

2. Run the Publisher
python src/main.py

3. Run the Logger (in another terminal)
python data/subscriber_logger.py

Requirements
Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
